At Muslim Harmony we are committed to protecting our clients' personal information. We have made it an obligation upon ourselves to make sure that our clients' information or identity stays completely confidential and will not be passed on to any other individuals or organizations without consent. We understand that our clients are concerned about their privacy, confidentiality, and security of any information that is provided.

We understand that it is not always easy for single individuals to feel complete confidence in registering for online matrimonial services. This is why we have made a unique system which does not allow individuals to search for others; instead it will generate searches for clients based on the key information they provide. The key to the success of our website is its unique searching system.
