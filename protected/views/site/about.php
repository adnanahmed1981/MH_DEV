	<p>
	Muslim Harmony was founded in 2007 by a group of people who were involved in personal match making, marriage events and online matching systems. 
	With our combined experience and expertise we have been able to bring to you muslimharmony.com.  
	</p>
	<p>
    Our goal is to make the problem of finding a partner easier using our online service.  
    With this service we aim to provide the muslim community with a reliable source of potential spouses.
    We have done considerable research into why marriages are increasingly susceptible to divorce or separation. 
    We have worked to ensure that you the user have the answers you need so as to avoid such setbacks. 
	</p>
	<p>
    We also encourage the involvement of all parents (wali's) throughout the process. 
    We have also incorporated further preventative measures such as a monitoring system that provides a round-the-clock surveillance of any suspicious or un-Islamic activity on the website. 
    Our goal is to create a portal that serves all the matrimonial needs of the Muslims and offers a service designed for those who are serious about marriage.
	</p>
	<p>
	We also have a sister site dedicated to <a href="www.muslimmarriageadvice.com">Muslim Marriage Advice</a>.
	There you will be able to find articles from leading experts and renowned scholars, on how to make pre and post marriage life pleasurable and blissful. 
	We are also aiming to provide accurate answers to any and all of your queries in this section. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Our ultimate goal is to make marriages easier for our community while making sure it's carried out in a way that is honorable and abides by Islamic principles. 
	We hope that this system can serve as our legacy right now and in the future, as well as our contribution to the Ummah. 
	We care for the Ummah and are committed to the cause, and we hope that Allah will put Barakah in this project. 
	May Allah accept our efforts and assist us in making things better for our Brothers and Sisters in Islam. Ameen!
