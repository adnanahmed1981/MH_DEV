	You will have the option of Accepting or Rejecting the match we have provided to you. When both parties accept the match then it allows for the following:
	<br>
	<br>
	a. Communication access with our state of the art system
	<br>
	b. Picture access can also be provided but that is upto your discretion
</p>

	Upgrading from Free to Premium Membership
</p>
<br>
<p style="font:normal 12px/14px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#606060; padding:0 0 15px; margin:0">
	A free profile allows you to receive free matches. As long as one member is paid then all communication and picture sharing can occur but the control will be with the premium users. If you are a premium user your chances of success will go up significantly as you will be allowed to communicate with all members on the service regardless of their membership status.

	We pray that Allah enables this service to help you in finding your life partner Ameen.
